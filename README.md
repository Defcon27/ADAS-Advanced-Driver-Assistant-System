# Project Co-Pilot (ADAS-Advanced Driver Assistance System)

### Problem aiming to solve
Advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) is an electronic systems that assist drivers in driving and safety functions.ADAS increase car and road safety. With increasing technology and rising concern among the population towards road safety, the demand for smart driver assistance systems have propelled significantly. It has become new criterion in the technology race among car manufacturers. But most of the manufacturers offer such advanced smart features at an additional cost of thousands of dollars and sometimes offer such facilities only in their flagship models.

#### The proposed solution consists of forward collision warning, lane analysis, traffic sign detection ,driver monitoring. This helps avoid accidents and collisions by alerting the driver to possible obstacles, assist in lane departure and similar safety features. Hence Co-Pilot is a great ADAS solution with many smart features for old and low-end cars at the same time cost-effective.
